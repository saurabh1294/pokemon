This is a simple app using D3.js and angular to show/plot weather data across different
parts of the globe. It's been developed using D3.js and AngularJS. The data shown is fake i.e
simulated. Only time and latitude/longitude of different locations is real




Setup instructions:-

Pull the github code from this repo and run the below commands for build and npm tools setup



npm install


grunt default - this will run the default grunt tasks


grunt dev - this will create dev versions of the js and css files in dist/dev folder


grunt prod - this will create minified and uglified js and css files in dist/prod folder for
production deployment.
